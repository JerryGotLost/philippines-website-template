## FAQ
#### Why does my site say broken link?
This is because you have:
- A folder too many, your files should be looking like = example folder example folder index.html example.html. These shouldn't be in a folder.
- You renamed the .html files and forgot to change the links.
#### DM me on Discord for more questions :D
